SAPStartSrv_basic_cluster \- basic settings to make SAPStartSrv work
.PP
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\"
The SAP Enqueue Standalone 2 (ENSA2) scenario needs a certain basic cluster
configuration. Besides this necessary settings, some additional configurations
might match specific needs.
.\" TODO Specifics ENSA1 vs. ENSA2?
.PP
\fB* Operating System Basics\fR

\fBtcp_retries2 = 8\fR

The OS network parameter tcp_retries2 TODO
A value of 8 to 10 TODO
.PP
\fB* CRM Basics\fR

\fBstonith-enabled = true\fR

The cib bootstrap option stonith-enabled is crucial for any reliable pacemaker
cluster.
.br
The value 'true' is one pre-requisite for having a cluster supported.  
.\"
.\" TODO cib: 	stonith-watdhog-timeout=10 ==> diskless SBD
.\" TODO cib: 	stonith-timeout=120 ==> disk-based SBD

\fBresource-stickiness = 1\fR

The crm rsc_default resource-stickiness defines the 'stickiness'
score a resource gets on the node where it is currently running. This prevents
the cluster from moving resources around whithout an urgent need during a
cluster transition. The correct value depends on number of resources, colocation
rules and resource groups. Particularly additional resources colocated to the
ASCS resource can affect cluster decisions. 
Too high value might prevent not only unwanted but also useful actions.
.br
A value of '1' TODO

\fBmigration-threshold = 3\fR

The crm rsc_defaul parameter migration-threshold defines how many errors on a
resource can be detected before this resource will be migrated to another node.
See also \fBfailure-timeout\fR.
.\" TODO needed for resource monitor option on-fail=restart
.br
A value of '3' TODO ENSA2

\fBrecord-pending = true\fR

The crm op_default record-pending defines, whether the intention of an action
upon the resource is recorded in the Cluster Information Base (CIB).
Setting this parameter to 'true' allows the user to see pending actions like
\'starting\' and \'stopping\' in crm_mon. Also the sap_suse_cluster_connector
interface uses this information.
.br
The value 'true' is needed for the sap_suse_cluster_connector interface TODO

\fBfailure-timeout = 86400s\fR

The crm op_default failure-timeout defines how long failed actions will
be kept in the CIB. After that time the failure record will be deleted. 
See also \fBmigration-threshold\fR.
.br
The value '86400s' means failure records will be cleaned automatically after
one day.

Below are examples of crm basic configuration for ENSA2 clusters.
Shown are specific parameters which are needed. Some general parameters are
left out.

\fB* ping resource for checking connectivity\fR

.\" TODO discuss what ping-based score might break ENSA scoring
Below is an example of an optional ping resource for checking connectivity to
the outer world. If the nodes have only one network interface, shared between
HA cluster and application, this measure does not improve availability.
.br
ASCS should run on an node from which more ping targets can be reached than
from others. If all nodes are same, ASCS stays where it is.
Three vital infrastructure servers outside the datacenter are choosen as ping
targets. If at least two targets are reacheable, the current node is preferred
for running the ASCS. The maximum time for detecting connectivity changes is
ca.180 seconds.
