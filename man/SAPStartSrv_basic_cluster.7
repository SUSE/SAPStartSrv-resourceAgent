SAPStartSrv_basic_cluster \- basic settings to make SAPStartSrv work
.PP
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\"
The SAP Enqueue Standalone 2 (ENSA2) scenario needs a certain basic cluster
configuration. Besides this necessary settings, some additional configurations
might match specific needs.
.\" TODO Specifics ENSA1 vs. ENSA2?
.PP
\fB* Operating System Basics\fR

\fBsystemd services\fR

The services sapinit, sapping and sappong are needed for this cluster.

For SystemV style saphostagent and sapstartsrv, the sapinit script needs to be
enabled.
For systemd style saphostagent and sapstartsrv, the service saphostagent needs
to be enabled and running, instance services SAP${SID}_${INO} need to be disabled.
See also REQUIREMENTS in man page ocf_suse_SAPStartSrv(7).
.PP
\fBtcp_retries2 = 9\fR

The OS network parameter tcp_retries2 influences the timeout of an alive TCP
connection, when retransmissions remain unacknowledged. The SAP application
servers (PAS/AAS) and central services (ASCS/ERS) are relying on TCP timeouts
for detecting lost connections. On the other hand SAP session timeouts and
enqueue replication timeouts are defined on application level. Tuning
tcp_retries2 helps SAP sessions and enqueue replication surviving cluster
actions.
.br
A value of 9 (for HZ=250) should let Linux TCP connections timeout fast enough
for default SAP application server and central services configuration.
.\" TODO NFS mount options for smooth takeover of sap instances, e.g. soft?
.PP
\fBUsers and groups\fR

Technical users and groups, such as <sid>adm are defined locally in the Linux
system. Further user <sid>adm needs to be in  group haclient.
See man page passwd(5) and usermod(8.

\fBHostnames\fR

Name resolution of the cluster nodes and the virtual IP address must be done
locally on all cluster nodes. See man page hosts(5).

\fBTime synchronization\fR

Strict time synchronization between the cluster nodes is mandatory, e.g. per NTP.
See man page chrony.conf(5).

\fBNFS mounted filesystems\fR

The shared filesystems /sapmnt/$SID/ and /usr/sap/$SID/ can be statically mounted
on all cluster nodes. See man page fstab(5) and example below.
.PP
\fB* CRM Basics\fR

\fBstonith-enabled = true\fR

The cib bootstrap option stonith-enabled is crucial for any reliable pacemaker
cluster.
.br
The value 'true' is one pre-requisite for having a cluster supported.  
.\"
.\" TODO cib: 	stonith-watdhog-timeout=10 ==> diskless SBD
.\" TODO cib: 	stonith-timeout=120 ==> disk-based SBD

\fBresource-stickiness = 1\fR

The crm rsc_default resource-stickiness defines the 'stickiness'
score a resource gets on the node where it is currently running. This prevents
the cluster from moving resources around whithout an urgent need during a
cluster transition. The correct value depends on number of resources, colocation
rules and resource groups. Particularly additional resources colocated to the
ASCS resource can affect cluster decisions. 
Too high value might prevent not only unwanted but also useful actions.
.br
.\" TODO A value of '1' ...

\fBmigration-threshold = 1\fR

The crm rsc_default parameter migration-threshold defines how many errors on a
resource can be detected before this resource will be moved to another node.
For ENSA1 the migration-threshold needs to be 1 always. For ENSA2 the value could
be higher. See also \fBfailure-timeout\fR .
.\" TODO needed for resource monitor option on-fail=restart
.br

\fBrecord-pending = true\fR

The crm op_default record-pending defines, whether the intention of an action
upon the resource is recorded in the Cluster Information Base (CIB).
Setting this parameter to \'true\' allows the user to see pending actions like
\'starting\' and \'stopping\' in crm_mon. Also the sap_suse_cluster_connector
interface uses this information.
.br

\fBfailure-timeout = 86400\fR

The crm op_default failure-timeout defines how long failed actions will
be kept in the CIB. After that time the failure record will be deleted.
Time unit is seconds. 
See also \fBmigration-threshold\fR.
.br
The value '86400' means failure records will be cleaned automatically after
one day.

\fBpriority-fencing-delay = 30\fP

The optional crm property priority-fencing-delay specified delay for the
fencings that are targeting the lost nodes with the highest total resource
priority in case we do not have the majority of the nodes in our cluster
partition, so that the more significant nodes potentially win any fencing
match, which is especially meaningful under split-brain of 2-node cluster.
A promoted resource instance takes the base priority + 1 on calculation if
the base priority is not 0. Any delay that are introduced by pcmk_delay_max
configured for the corresponding fencing resources will be added to this
delay. A meta attribute priority=100 or alike for the ASCS resource is needed
to make this work. See ocf_suse_SAPStartSrv(7).

The delay should be significantly greater than, or safely twice,
pcmk_delay_max.

\fB* crm basic configuration\fR
.\" TODO scenario specific CIB basic settings

Below are examples of crm basic configuration for ENSA2 clusters.

left out.

\fB* NFS shares for SAP instance filesystems\fR

Below is an fstab example for filesystems needed by the ASCS/ERS pair.
The filesystems are statically mounted on all nodes of the cluster for SAP
system EN2. The SAP instance name is used consequently to prepare for optional
multi-SID setups. The parent directory /usr/sap/ resides on each node locally.
The file sapservices must not be shared between nodes.
The correct mount options are depending on the NFS server.

\fB* ping resource for checking connectivity\fR

.\" TODO discuss what ping-based score might break ENSA scoring
Below is an example of an optional ping resource for checking connectivity to
the outer world. If the nodes have only one network interface, shared between
HA cluster and application, this measure does not improve availability.
.br
ASCS should run on an node from which more ping targets can be reached than
from others. If all nodes are same, ASCS stays where it is.
Three vital infrastructure servers outside the datacenter are choosen as ping
targets. If at least two targets are reachable, the current node is preferred
for running the ASCS. The maximum time for detecting connectivity changes is
ca.180 seconds.

\fB* systemd services for the SAP instance\fR
.PP
In case systemd style init is used for the SAP instance:
saphostagent needs to be enabled and running, instance services need
to be disabled. Example SID is HA1, instance number is 10.

\fB* SAP instance profile\fR

Example SID is EN2, instance number is 10.
